Exclusion of of accsess from outsiders. Intranet is safer and used for internal communication like delivering tools. Connected to gateways/ROUTER. Internet is accessible to everyone and reachable, used for e-commerce, websites and so on. 





## Task 
How to make a network using a router:

Connect, router with ethernet cable to the computer. Log into the router. Install the MosQuiTTO tools. Configure MQTT listener for listening. Connect your phone with the network. Donwload MyMQTT, log in listener details and create a topic to send messages. All done.



## Task First Aid button

Made a iot network, that was connected to esp8266, and computer. Because we had a broken power splitter, then we couldn't use our phone with usb port to tether the internet. So we used our phones hotspot named Vork, made the router repat it (the repeat mini project) and sent the messages with that network.


## Reflection 3
Had a pit trouble with set up, aswell with the usb tethering and wireless set up. Tried to fix it many times, but in the end, just deleted everything and started again, and the wireless set up worked.
